I have travelled to an unknown island
Where am I now?
Hi, little bee! Are you lost?
Yes, I don't know where am I...
Don't worry little bee
This is Nanyang Bee Farm. A beautiful bee farm in this small island.
Oh, a bee farm! So can I live with the bees here?
Yes, of course! Welcome to our big family!
